I recommend checking out my 3 minute tutorial video how to add burst package:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz-4jURHxIk&t=21s

Installing package: "Burst"
It is located under "Windows" > "Package Manager" > Select Burst > Install
If the Package Manager does not exist, click on "All Packages"

If the console spills following:
Unity/cache/packages/packages.unity.com/com.unity.burst@0.2.4-preview.37/Editor/BurstAotCompiler.cs(19,11):
error CS1644: Feature `using static' cannot be used because it is not part of theC# 4.0 language specification

go to Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Setting > Change Scripting Runtime Version to .net 4.X equivalent 


Note:
This folder contains placeholder of the Burst and Collection package.
Placeholder for collections is a sample of the collection package v 0.1.0.

After installing the "Collections" package, these files are not compiled anymore.
